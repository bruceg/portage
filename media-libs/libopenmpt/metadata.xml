libopenmpt is a cross-platform C++ and C library to decode tracked music
files (modules) [wikipedia] into a raw PCM audio stream.

openmpt123 is a cross-platform command-line or terminal based module
file player.

libopenmpt is based on the player code of the OpenMPT project (Open
ModPlug Tracker, https://openmpt.org/). In order to avoid code base
fragmentation, libopenmpt is developed in the same source code
repository as OpenMPT.

Language bindings are available for a variety of other programming
languages.
